<html><head>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="example.css" media="screen" type="text/css">
<!--The MEDIA attribute is used under CSS2 to provide an indication of which media the style sheet should apply to. This attribute enables the page designer to define one style for computer screens, one for print, and perhaps one for personal digital assistants (PDAs). For example, a document could include two links, one for screen and one for print
Multiple values may also be set for the attribute. These should be separated by commas, to show that the style may apply to many media forms—for example, MEDIA="screen,print"
The last thing to note in the linked style sheet example is the use of the TYPE attribute in the <LINK> element, which is set to the MIME type "text/css". This value indicates that the linked style sheet is a cascading style sheet, but another form of style sheet certainly could be linked.
To avoid having to use the TYPE attribute, you may want to set a default style sheet language in the <HEAD> element of the document by using the <META> element, as shown here:
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Style-Type" Content="text/css">-->

<!--A style rule has three parts: selector, property, and value.
We can group all html tags for styling to save our time & code length in css. Its the way we group our variables together in programing.

Like for CSS:

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, li, p {
    color: pink; 
    background-color:black;
}
type selector
1.H1-H6
2.P
3.Body
now class selector:this one introduced with a class=name
always starts with a ( . ) example:
.exmp { color:red; background-color:yellow;}
to apply just use :
<p class= "exmp">those texts are red with yellow background</p>

part three id selector:
id selector names is css should start with # like:
in css:
#exmp { color:red;background-color:yellow;}
to apply in html use:
<p id=exmp>all text will have red color yellow background>
remark:Id cannot be use again in same page,but class can be used as much as you need.
a space should be there after type  p, <h1>
otherwise css will not apply.
you also can leave the last line of a same block of CSS declaration, without a semicolon:
-->
<h5>This is a heading</h5>
<p class="example0">This is a paragraph</p>
<p class="left">This paragraph is aligned to <strong>left.</strong></p>

This paragraph has an image that is floated to the <strong>right.</strong> 
It is highly recommended to add a margin to images so that the text does 
not get too close to the image. If you want your text to be easily read, you 
should always add a few pixels between words and borders, images, 
and other content.
